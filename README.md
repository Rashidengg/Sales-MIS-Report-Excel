Sales MIS Report
This project involves building a Sales MIS (Management Information System) report using Excel. The key steps include:

Data Cleaning: 
We start by cleaning the sales data to ensure accuracy.

Pivot Tables & Charts: 
We use pivot tables and charts to analyze sales figures, break them down by individual salesmen, and look at yearly trends.

VLOOKUPs: 
VLOOKUP functions are used to match and retrieve data based on sales figures, making it easier to track performance by salesman.

Salesman Performance: 
The report also includes a breakdown of each salesmanâ€™s performance, focusing on sales targets and profits.

This report is designed to help understand overall sales performance, track individual contributions, and make data-driven decisions.
